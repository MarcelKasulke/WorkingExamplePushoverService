Pushover Send for use with Galaxy Watch
=======================================
 I was searching for a comfort way to send messages to my mobile phone.
 So it's not easy as you might think but here is the workaround I used and it's really stable.
 This program shows how to send a message to you mobile phone and your Samsung Smart Watch.

 These are some test methods for the Pushover Service in Java.
 This way to send messages is very easy but needs a special service which is called Pushover.
 The service is for free.
 
 What you need:
 -------------
 Pushover App on your phone
 Some Java-Program or Commandline-Tool that triggers the classes that I added here
 A lot of the code was writte by serveral other people but here I wanted to add a working example that can be reused.

Compatibility
-------------
- We are talking about the Pushover Service Provider, the Android or IPhone App and the Samsung Galaxy Watch only.
  Other watches might work but I never tested it in detail.

- Newer version of part of this program might be available from other sources.
