/**
* These are some test methods for the Pushover Service in Java.
* I wanted to send messages to my Smart Watch which is a Samsung Galaxy Watch.
* This way to send messages is very easy but needs a special service which is called Pushover.
* The service is for free.
* 
* What you need:
* Pushover App on your phone
* Some Java-Program or Commandline-Tool that triggers the classes that I added here
* A lot of the code was writte by serveral other people but here I wanted to add a working example that can be reused.
